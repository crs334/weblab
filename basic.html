                <h2>History of the English Labrador</h2>
                <p>Way back in the <strong>1800s,</strong> my Labrador ancestors were hardworking fishing dogs in Newfoundland. They helped to reel in nets, swim through cold water, and fetch about anything. Some of us traveled over to England where breeders shaped us into the English Labs you see today. Now, we’re a little stockier, calmer, and always ready for a piece of food to drop. We’ve always been loyal hunters, helpers, and cuddle buddies, the true man’s best friend!</p>

                <h2> Temperament: Gentle, Loving, Loyal</h2>
                <p>English Labs are known for their calm, yet energetic, temperament, stocky builds, and loyal nature. We are affectionate, playful, and thrive in a family who gives us attention, love, and <strong>lots</strong> of tennis balls. We are great with kids and love making new friends; we’re basically big walking teddy bears.</p>
